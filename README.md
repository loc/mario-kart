# To use with streaming
You need `ffmpeg` installed to read from streams.
nginx has a nice rtmp server that can allow redirecting and incoming streams.

Setup nginx with `brew` and setup a config
```
brew install nginx-full --with-rtmp-module
cat <<EOF > /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/kart.conf
rtmp {
        server {
                listen 1935;
                chunk_size 4096;
                application castle {
                        play /path/to/mario-kart;
                }
        }
}
EOF
```

Start nginx 
```
nginx
```

You can stop with 
```
nginx -s stop
```

Make sure you can watch the video:
```
brew install mplayer
mplayer rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/castle/bowsers-castle.mp4
```

Read from the stream:
```
brew install ffmpeg
python read.py rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/castle/bowsers-castle.mp4
```
